# Agoraland

Praxis of agorism in development of Liberland

## Project details

Agoraland is a project for bringing together investors and settlers to connect investments, donations and labor.
Many investors who have purchased citizenship or donated to Liberland don't have the skills to settle the land,
nor the ability to negotiate wages and payments for settlers, who would homestead in their place. This problem requires
a well-connected organizer to act as a proxy between laborers and international investors. Our project seeks to create
a safe, trusted space where investors can engage with organizers to build lasting settlements in Liberland.

This project has three distinct roles: investor, organizer and laborer. In the first phase, we will establish connections
with experienced organizers in order to get them to advertise their services on our site. In the second phase, we will use social media,
influencers and advertisements to attract investors to our cause. Third phase will require the organizers to advertise to laborers, not 
just in Croatia but all around Europe to get them to come into Liberland and begin work. Third phase of this project will likely be cyclical,
due to the actions of Croatian police making it necessary to rebuild already established projects.

To this end, we will create a censorship resistant website, using Fleek hosting. This website will have the aforementioned features,
as well as dApp features to allow for easy crypto payments, using MetaMask and Subwallet extensions to ensure easy transactions within various
crypto ecosystems. In order to ensure trust between investors and organizers, our website will contain review system and ranking system,
where investors can post comments and ratings. For organizers, our site will contain basic timetables,
as well as salary calculators so they can pay their laborers in the manner of the laborers choosing.

## User stories

As an investor, named Max, I want to be able to hire an organizer, Sasha, in order to
procure workers to build a house for me in Liberland, so I don't have to build it myself,
or hire laborers from other countries.

As an organizer, named Sasha, I want to get Max to invest in homesteading Liberland and hire
the laborer, Mike, to do it. I want to be able to easily track Mikes progress and give Max periodic updates.

As a laborer, Mike, I want to get paid to build housing in Liberland from Sasha. I want to know how much I'm
getting paid and be able to tell Sasha my preferred payment method. I want to know what I'm doing next as well.
